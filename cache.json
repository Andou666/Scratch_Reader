          "description": "We've read through all your thoughts about this update. We appreciate the folks who have remained constructive and thoughtful with their feedback. This is the most effective way to communicate your concerns with us! We can assure you that we are aware that this is a very significant change in the way that studios work. These changes are designed to address a variety of issues — moving away from an old codebase that is difficult to maintain, improving site performance, addressing suggestions and concerns we have heard from the community, and safety considerations.<br/><br/>We wanted to address a couple common things we’ve seen come up since the update. First, we hear you that the comment limit has made it difficult for text-based roleplayers to have long and drawn out conversations. The original, and current, intention of studios was for them to be a space where Scratchers can comment and collaborate on projects that share a common theme. We are aware that many people have used studios for a variety of purposes other than sharing and collaborating on projects, and that text-based roleplaying is one of those things. That’s always been okay so long as the activities follow the Community Guidelines. However, we can’t make decisions about Scratch features based on how they will impact text-based roleplaying. The changes to comment thread limits are meant to make studios of all themes have conversations involving all members of the studios stay near the top of studios, and that’s unfortunately at odds with the way text-based roleplayers use comment threads.<br/><br/>We hear your concerns about studio manager permissions and what happens if a studio owner is no longer active or interested in the studio they created. We’ve begun working on some ideas to address studio ownership transfers and will share more details about that with you in the future, so stay tuned!<br/><br/>We know that change is difficult, and it can take some time to get used to. Scratch is continuing to grow and we want to make sure it stays around for a long time. These changes were made as a way for us to help ensure Scratch continues to run smoothly, quickly, and safely for everyone who uses it long into the future.<br/><br/>We are going to close the topic but if you have constructive suggestions for future studio updates, please check out the <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/1/\">Suggestions Forum</a> to talk through your suggestions with other community members. And if you run into bugs or glitches in studios, please visit the <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/3/\">Bugs and Glitches Forum</a> to report them. We’re keeping an eye on these spaces and will continue to take your feedback and suggestions into consideration.",

Not to mention, it kills off the entire existence of RP studios, makes important manners much harder to discuss for the time that may be needed, and is basically an update that did the opposite of it's intention: By trying to encourage including more people in your conversation, you basically discouraged conversing in studios AT ALL. My workaround for it is to close studio comments and add a link to a project where people discuss studio manners instead to completely dodge the reply limit. In fact, should we actually boycott usage of studios until they fix these issues?
